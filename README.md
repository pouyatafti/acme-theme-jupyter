# acme-ish theme for jupyter

This theme is for the most part blatantly copied from @neilpanchal's [spinzero theme](https://github.com/neilpanchal/spinzero-jupyter-theme).  The only major difference is the colour scheme for code cells, which is inspired by [Acme](http://acme.cat-v.org)'s, and, in particular, the absence of syntax highlighting (replaced partly by bold and italic font variants).  I'd also change the fonts to be more faithful to Acme, but I'm too lazy.

## installation

Copy `custom.css` and (optionally) `custom.js` to `$HOME/.jupyter/custom/` or equivalent.  Then head over to Neil Panchal's [original repository](https://github.com/neilpanchal/spinzero-jupyter-theme) and collect and copy the `fonts` folder from there to the same location (i.e. `$HOME/.jupyter/custom/fonts`).  I haven't included the fonts because I'm not sure about their licensing terms (although I'm pretty sure you can't use them commercially).
